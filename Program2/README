CPE453-Program 2 schedSim
Damien Trunkey, Sereen Benchohra, Danveer Cheema

Special instructions: We used python for this program so we had to create and executable called schedSim.exe but it can be invoked by just 'schedSim'
from the command line with no .exe extension. A sample schedSim run looks like:

schedSim <file.txt> -p <algorithm> -q <quantum>

Answers to Questions:

1.) STRN will have the same turnaround times as FIFO when the burst time corresponds with the arrival time i.e. the shortest job arrives first.
They also have the same turnaround times when all jobs have the same burst time.

2.) When the quantum length is larger than the highest burst time and the jobs arrive in increasing order of job size.

3.) Average response time for all the jobs will go up because they will have to wait for all the previous jobs to execute before being scheduled.

4.) Average response time will increase for all the jobs as the quantum increases because all jobs after the current job have to wait longer.
The worst case response time for all jobs is Q(N-1) where Q is the quantum and N is the number of jobs.
