CPE 453 Program 4 - TinyFS and Disk operations
Damien Trunkey, Danveer Cheema, Sereen Benchohra


1.) An explanation of how well your TinyFS implementation works

We believe our tinyFS works well. There are a few bugs that we couldn't
figure out how to fix due to time constraints. The basic functionality of 
our program is there, but there are edge cases and error checks that are
unaccounted for.


2.) An explanation of which additional functionality areas you have chosen and how you have shown that it works.

We decided to implement the renaming function and the stats function. We showed how it works
through the demo by printing the desired output.


3.) Any limitations or bugs your file system has.

There are a few bugs in our code where some file contents get overwritten. This is probably due
to the fact that we use python lists to store our files/fileSystem data. Also our 
TFS_Delete function didn't work as intended.




To run the demo simply put in the command line:

TinyFSDemo
